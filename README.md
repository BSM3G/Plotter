# Plotter

## Things to come

There currently isn't a way to plot signal (you can make it a background act like a background, the the actual functionality hasn't been fully added to the code

More flexible legend position/sizer.  Maybe a dynamic system to have the legend not obscure the graph.  Long term goal

# How to Run

simply type
```
make
./Plotter config/<YOUR CONFIG FILE>
```

The config files are given names based on the update time, so to make sure you are using the correct values for cross-section and luminosity, use the newest config file

To change the looks of the graph, most of the style options are in the style directory.  The default style is used if nothing is specified in the config file, but any personal style can be made

More documentation on the styles to come.
